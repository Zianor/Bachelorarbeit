The QRS complex has different morphology and frequency band for different arrhythmias and noises in ECG signals. A standard bandpass range that maximizes the signal (QRS complex)-to-noise (T-waves, 60 Hz, EMG, etc.) ratio will be useful in ECG monitoring and diagnostic tools. A sensitive QRS detection algorithm has been introduced to compare the performance of using different frequency bands. The results shows that the recommended bandpass frequency range for detecting QRS complexes is 8-20Hz which the best signal-to-noise ratio.},

abstract = {While bed-integrated ballistocardiography (BCG) has potential clinical applications such as unobtrusive monitoring of patients staying in the general hospital ward, it has so far mainly gained interest in the wellness domain. In this article, the potential of BCG to monitor hospitalized patients after surgical intervention was assessed. Long-term BCG recordings (mean duration 17.7 h) of 14 patients were performed with an EMFit QS bed sensor. In addition, ten healthy subjects were recorded during sleep (mean duration 7.8 h). Using an iterative algorithm, beat-to-beat intervals (BBIs) and the ultra-short-term heart-rate-variability (HRV) parameters standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) were estimated and compared to an ECG reference in terms of average estimation error and temporal coverage. While the absolute BBI estimation error was found to be higher when full-day patient data was used (16.5 ms), no significant difference between healthy subjects (12.7 ms) and patient nighttime data (11.0 ms) was observed. Nevertheless, temporal coverage of BBI estimation was significantly lower in patients (39.3{\%} overall, 51.7{\%} at night) compared to the healthy sleepers (73.2{\%}). This resulted in reduced HRV estimation coverage (9.7{\%} vs. 37.2{\%}) at comparable estimation error levels.},

abstract = {Detection of noisy ballistocardiogram (BCG) measurements with a matched filter is investigated. The BCG signal is segmented by the RR intervals of the concurrently recorded electrocardiogram (ECG). These segments are called BCG heartbeats and are averaged to estimate a parent template and sub-templates of BCG heartbeats leveraging the quasi-periodic nature of the heart. All BCG heartbeats in the measurement are used to estimate the parent template BCG heartbeat. By contrast, sub-templates are estimated using subsets of BCG heartbeats that extend over several breaths to capture the variations in the phase of the BCG heartbeat due to the breathing cycles. The parent template BCG heartbeat in a recording is regarded as the subject-specific matched filter. Finally, the average correlation coefficient between sub-templates and the parent template BCG heartbeat in a recording is proposed as the signal quality index (SQI). A seven-step experiment was performed among thirteen subjects. For reliable parent template estimation, at least 40 BCG heartbeats should be recorded. For detection of noisy BCG measurements, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was presented for conditions of motion artifacts, speaking, and deep breathing. Motion artifacts could be detected with lower false positive rates for the same constraint on the detection rate, when compared to speaking and deep breathing cases. This work may facilitate online detection of noisy BCG recordings.},

abstract = {Reliable and accurate estimation of instantaneous frequencies of physiological rhythms, such as heart rate, is critical for many healthcare applications. Robust estimation is especially challenging when novel unobtrusive sensors are used for continuous health monitoring in uncontrolled environments, because these sensors can create significant amounts of potentially unreliable data. We propose a new flexible algorithm for the robust estimation of local (beat-to-beat) intervals from cardiac vibration signals, specifically ballistocardiograms (BCGs), recorded by an unobtrusive bed-mounted sensor. This sensor allows the measurement of motions of the body which are caused by cardiac activity. Our method requires neither a training phase nor any prior knowledge about the morphology of the heart beats in the analyzed waveforms. Instead, three short-time estimators are combined using a Bayesian approach to continuously estimate the inter-beat intervals. We have validated our method on over-night BCG recordings from 33 subjects (8 normal, 25 insomniacs). On this dataset, containing approximately one million heart beats, our method achieved a mean beat-to-beat interval error of 0.78{\%} with a coverage of 72.69{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present and evaluate algorithms for heartbeat interval estimation from multiple spatially distributed force sensors integrated into a bed. Moreover, the benefit of using multichannel systems as opposed to a single sensor is investigated. While it might seem intuitive that multiple channels are superior to a single channel, the main challenge lies in finding suitable methods to actually leverage this potential. To this end, two algorithms for heart rate estimation from multichannel vibration signals are presented and compared against a single-channel sensing solution. The first method operates by analyzing the cepstrum computed from the average spectra of the individual channels, while the second method applies Bayesian fusion to three interval estimators, such as the autocorrelation, which are applied to each channel. This evaluation is based on 28 night-long sleep lab recordings during which an eight-channel polyvinylidene fluoride-based sensor array was used to acquire cardiac vibration signals. The recruited patients suffered from different sleep disorders of varying severity. From the sensor array data, a virtual single-channel signal was also derived for comparison by averaging the channels. The single-channel results achieved a beat-to-beat interval error of 2.2{\%} with a coverage (i.e., percentage of the recording which could be analyzed) of 68.7{\%}. In comparison, the best multichannel results attained a mean error and coverage of 1.0{\%} and 81.0{\%}, respectively. These results present statistically significant improvements of both metrics over the single-channel results (p {\textless} 0.05).},

abstract = {A completely automated algorithm to detect poor-quality electrocardiograms (ECGs) is described. The algorithm is based on both novel and previously published signal quality metrics, originally designed for intensive care monitoring. The algorithms have been adapted for use on short (5-10s) single- and multi-lead ECGs. The metrics quantify spectral energy distribution, higher order moments and inter-channel and inter-algorithm agreement. Seven metrics were calculated for each channel (84features in all) and presented to either a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network or a support vector machine (SVM) for training on a multiple-annotator labelled and adjudicated training dataset. A single-lead version of the algorithm was also developed in a similar manner. Data were drawn from the PhysioNet Challenge 2011 dataset where binary labels were available, on 1500 12-lead ECGs indicating whether the entire recording was acceptable or unacceptable for clinical interpretation. We re-annotated all the leads in both the training set (1000 labelled ECGs) and test dataset (500 12-lead ECGs where labels were not publicly available) using two independent annotators, and a third for adjudication of differences. We found that low-quality data accounted for only 16{\%} of the ECG leads. To balance the classes (between high and low quality), we created extra noisy data samples by adding noise from PhysioNets noise stress test database to some of the clean 12-lead ECGs. No data were shared between training and test sets. A classification accuracy of 98{\%} on the training data and 97{\%} on the test data were achieved. Upon inspection, incorrectly classified data were found to be borderline cases which could be classified either way. If these cases were more consistently labelled, we expect our approach to achieve an accuracy closer to 100{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

This paper is an effort to compare and contrast this novel wave of research (notably in the context of the authors' own work). It also suggests that the new approaches have several key differences with past embodiments that place them in a good position to address some specific issues such as cardiac resynchronization therapy device optimization or congestive heart failure monitoring. This optimism is largely fed by the recent technological advances enabling the measurement of the BCG unobtrusively, frequently, at home or in a hospital, and by a re-focus on monitoring and trending applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

The return of the needle is effected by a series of secondary vibrations which appear to bear an appreciable but imperfect analogy to corresponding features in the sphyg-mograph. This phenomenon may very easily be verified, but in re-peating the experiment it should be borne in mind that the following are desiderata:-That the skeleton of the subject be brought as nearly as possible into contact with the instrument and that the hip-and knee-joints be so disposed as to secure the maximum possible of rigidity in a perpendicular direction. It does not appear that this phenomenon has heretofore been anticipated by any process of theorising, or turned to any useful account.

abstract = {In this work, we describe a beat-by-beat method for assessing the clinical utility of pulsatile waveforms, primarily recorded from cardiovascular blood volume or pressure changes, concentrating on the photoplethysmogram (PPG). Physiological blood flow is nonstationary, with pulses changing in height, width and morphology due to changes in heart rate, cardiac output, sensor type and hardware or software pre-processing requirements. Moreover, considerable inter-individual and sensor-location variability exists. Simple template matching methods are therefore inappropriate, and a patient-specific adaptive initialization is therefore required. We introduce dynamic time warping to stretch each beat to match a running template and combine it with several other features related to signal quality, including correlation and the percentage of the beat that appeared to be clipped. The features were then presented to a multi-layer perceptron neural network to learn the relationships between the parameters in the presence of good- and bad-quality pulses. An expert-labeled database of 1055 segments of PPG, each 6s long, recorded from 104 separate critical care admissions during both normal and verified arrhythmic events, was used to train and test our algorithms. An accuracy of 97.5{\%} on the training set and 95.2{\%} on test set was found. The algorithm could be deployed as a stand-alone signal quality assessment algorithm for vetting the clinical utility of PPG traces or any similar quasi-periodic signal. {\textcopyright} 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

abstract = {An unconstrained respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) monitoring system to be used during sleeping is proposed. The system consisted of eight polyvinylidene fluoride cable sensors, charge amplifiers and measuring software, together with an analogue-to-digital converter unit. The cable sensors were horizontally embedded into a textile sheet on a bed surface covering the upper half of the body. The digital infinite impulse response filters were constructed to extract cardiorespiratory signals from displacement of the sensors. The system software automatically searched the optimum sensor(s) based on the power of the respective filter outputs. Then, the system obtained the 5 s average HR and 15 s average RR by measuring the intervals between the peaks of the respective autocorrelation functions of the filtered output. If the subject changed his posture, the system captured the image of the body position as a time stamp using a CCD camera. To show the validity of this method, the HR and RR obtained by this monitor were compared with those simultaneously measured using respiratory flow and an electrocardiogram. The results showed that the mean frame-by-frame difference ranged from -1.2 to 0.2 beats min-1 for the HR and, for RR, ranged from -0.8 to 1.4 breath min-1 during the short-term recordings. Similar differences were obtained during the first 2 h of overnight recordings. The proposed system is feasible for the combined long-term monitoring of a person's RR and HR with sleep posture changes and may be helpful for practical use in the home. {\textcopyright} IFMBE 2005.},

abstract = {Artifact detection (AD) techniques minimize the impact of artifacts on physiologic data acquired in critical care units (CCU) by assessing quality of data prior to clinical event detection (CED) and parameter derivation (PD). This methodological review introduces unique taxonomies to synthesize over 80 AD algorithms based on these six themes: 1) CCU; 2) physiologic data source; 3) harvested data; 4) data analysis; 5) clinical evaluation; and 6) clinical implementation. Review results show that most published algorithms: a) are designed for one specific type of CCU; b) are validated on data harvested only from one OEM monitor; c) generate signal quality indicators (SQI) that are not yet formalized for useful integration in clinical workflows; d) operate either in standalone mode or coupled with CED or PD applications; e) are rarely evaluated in real-time; and f) are not implemented in clinical practice. In conclusion, it is recommended that AD algorithms conform to generic input and output interfaces with commonly defined data: 1) type; 2) frequency; 3) length; and 4) SQIs. This shall promote: a) reusability of algorithms across different CCU domains; b) evaluation on different OEM monitor data; c) fair comparison through formalized SQIs; d) meaningful integration with other AD, CED and PD algorithms; and e) real-time implementation in clinical workflows. {\textcopyright} 2008-2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {The identification of invalid data in recordings obtained using wearable sensors is of particular importance since data obtained from mobile patients is, in general, noisier than data obtained from nonmobile patients. In this paper, we present a signal quality index (SQI), which is intended to assess whether reliable heart rates (HRs) can be obtained from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals collected using wearable sensors. The algorithms were validated on manually labeled data. Sensitivities and specificities of 94{\%} and 97{\%} were achieved for the ECG and 91{\%} and 95{\%} for the PPG. Additionally, we propose two applications of the SQI. First, we demonstrate that, by using the SQI as a trigger for a power-saving strategy, it is possible to reduce the recording time by up to 94{\%} for the ECG and 93{\%} for the PPG with only minimal loss of valid vital-sign data. Second, we demonstrate how an SQI can be used to reduce the error in the estimation of respiratory rate (RR) from the PPG. The performance of the two applications was assessed on data collected from a clinical study on hospital patients who were able to walk unassisted.},

abstract = {Due to recent technological improvements, namely in the field of piezoelectric sensors, ballistocardiography – an almost forgotten physiological measurement – is now being object of a renewed scientific interest.Transcending the initial purposes of its development, ballistocardiography has revealed itself to be a useful informative signal about the cardiovascular system status, since it is a non-intrusive technique which is able to assess the body's vibrations due to its cardiac, and respiratory physiological signatures.Apart from representing the outcome of the electrical stimulus to the myocardium – which may be obtained by electrocardiography – the ballistocardiograph has additional advantages, as it can be embedded in objects of common use, such as a bed or a chair. Moreover, it enables measurements without the presence of medical staff, factor which avoids the stress caused by medical examinations and reduces the patient's involuntary psychophysiological responses.Given these attributes, and the crescent number of systems developed in recent years, it is therefore pertinent to revise all the information available on the ballistocardiogram's physiological interpretation, its typical waveform information, its features and distortions, as well as the state of the art in device implementations.},

abstract = {This work implements a noninvasive system that measures the movements caused by cardiac activity. It uses unobtrusive Electro-Mechanical Films (EMFi) on the seat and on the backrest of a regular chair. The system detects ballistocardiogram (BCG) and respiration movements. Real data was obtained from 54 volunteers. 19 of them were measured in the laboratory and 35 in a hospital waiting room. Using a BIOPAC acquisition system, the ECG was measured simultaneously to the BCG for comparison. Wavelet Transform (WT) is a better option than Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for signal extraction and produces higher effective measurement time. In the laboratory, the best results are obtained on the seat. The correlation index was 0.9800 and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were 0.7136 ± 4.3673 [BPM]. In the hospital waiting room, the best results are also from the seat sensor. The correlation index was 0.9840, and the limits of agreement were 0.4386 ± 3.5884 [BPM]. The system is able to measure BCG in an unobtrusive way and determine the cardiac frequency with high precision. It is simple to use, which means the system can easily be used in non-standard settings: resting in a chair or couch, at the gym, schools or in a hospital waiting room, as shown.},

@article{Sadek2019,
abstract = {Time-domain algorithms are focused on detecting local maxima or local minima using a moving window, and therefore finding the interval between the dominant J-peaks of ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal. However, this approach has many limitations due to the nonlinear and nonstationary behavior of the BCG signal. This is because the BCG signal does not display consistent J-peaks, which can usually be the case for overnight, in-home monitoring, particularly with frail elderly. Additionally, its accuracy will be undoubtedly affected by motion artifacts. Second, frequency-domain algorithms do not provide information about interbeat intervals. Nevertheless, they can provide information about heart rate variability. This is usually done by taking the fast Fourier transform or the inverse Fourier transform of the logarithm of the estimated spectrum, i.e., cepstrum of the signal using a sliding window. Thereafter, the dominant frequency is obtained in a particular frequency range. The limit of these algorithms is that the peak in the spectrum may get wider and multiple peaks may appear, which might cause a problem in measuring the vital signs. At last, the objective of wavelet-domain algorithms is to decompose the signal into different components, hence the component which shows an agreement with the vital signs can be selected i.e., the selected component contains only information about the heart cycles or respiratory cycles, respectively. An empirical mode decomposition is an alternative approach to wavelet decomposition, and it is also a very suitable approach to cope with nonlinear and nonstationary signals such as cardiorespiratory signals. Apart from the above-mentioned algorithms, machine learning approaches have been implemented for measuring heartbeats. However, manual labeling of training data is a restricting property.},

abstract = {Opportunistic ambient sensing involves placement of sensors appropriately so that intermittent contact can be made unobtrusively for gathering physiological signals for vital signs. In this paper, we discuss the results of our quality processing system used to extract heart rate from ballisto-cardiogram signals obtained from a micro-bending fiber optic sensor pressure mat. Visual inspection is used to label data into informative and non-informative classes based on their heart rate information. Five classifiers are employed for the classification process, i.e., random forest, support vector machine, multilayer, feedforward neural network, linear discriminant analysis, and decision tree. To compute the overall effectiveness of quality processing, the informative signals are processed to estimate interbeat intervals. The system was used to process, data collected from 50 human subjects sitting in a massage chair while performing different activities. Opportunistically collected data was obtained from the fiber optic sensor mat placed on the headrest of the massage chair. Using our classification approach, 57.37{\%} of the dataset was able to provide informative signals. On the informative signals, random forest classifier achieves the best classification accuracy with a mean accuracy of 98.99{\%}. The average of the mean absolute error between the estimated heart rate and the reference ECG is reduced from 13.2 to 8.47. Therefore, the proposed system shows a good robustness for opportunistic ambient sensing.},

@article{Starr1939,
abstract = {The movements imparted to the human body by the impacts of the blood were first recorded by Yandell Henderson (1905) by means of a " swinging table " and a set of levers. His subjects had to arrest or suppress respira-tion before a record of movements synchronous with the heart beat could be obtained. A relation between cardiac output and the amplitude of these movements was suggested. On the Pike's Peak expedition (Douglas et al., 1913) a simplified form of the apparatus, a plank supported on piles of corks, was used to ascertain whether altitude affected cardiac output. Heald and Tucker's (1922) subject stood on a platform suspended from the diaphragm of a drum. Movement was recorded by changes in the current flowing through a hot wire placed in the drum's air inlet. The direction of the movements could not be ascertained from their records. Nevertheless normal respiratory activity did not interfere with the record of the cardiac movements and the effect of the respiratory cycle on these movements was clearly shown. Increased amplitude was demonstrated after exercise, after nitroglycerine, and in a patient with aortic regurgi-tation. Angenheister and Laue (1928) published 5 records obtained from a seismograph placed on a rigid table on which their subject lay. Four of these records are similar to those we obtain. Abramson (1933) built a chair of aluminum alloy suspended from steel springs which were embedded in a cast steel base on a concrete foundation. The movements were greatly magnified by a patented device and photo-graphed. The great nicety of construction was indicated by the high vi- bration frequency, 75 per second with 70 kgm. of dead weight on the chair. The records from Abramson's " Kardiodynamograph " were essentially similar to those we obtain. From theoretical conceptions Abramson (1933) developed a formula re-lating the double integral of his curves to the cardiac output. Experi-ments on this subject were projected but we can find no record of the results obtained. Our experiments indicate that cardiac output cannot be es-timated from this formula. Our apparatus is a modification of the hanging table originally employed by Henderson (1904) and so is much simpler and less expensive than Abramson's (1933) apparatus. Instead of a table swinging free, which we tried and abandoned, we have opposed the longitudinal motion by a strong steel spring, a change which has abolished the interference due to the movements of normal respiration. Optical methods of magnification and recording have supplanted the original lever and kymograph system. With this apparatus we have confirmed the findings of our predecessors in this field regarding the general shape of the normal cardiac ballistic curve and the effect of exercise, and certain drugs, upon its amplitude. We have also conducted extensive experiments into the sources of error, and found that these are due to certain properties of the human body rather than to defects of apparatus. The knowledge gained has suggested methods of avoiding or minimizing these errors. With this as a back-ground we have developed new theoretical conceptions of the forces in-volved and have derived new formulae for estimating cardiac output. The great majority of results obtained from these formulae agree well with those secured by the improved ethyl iodide method (Starr and Gamble, 1927). The design and construction of our apparatus was the work of Rawson. Joseph performed the analyses of ethyl iodide and assisted in the estima-tion of cardiac output by that method. We received valuable assistance from Dr. H. K. Hartline in setting up the optical recording system, from Dr. Alan Burton in certain physical and mathematical aspects of our problems, and from Dr. Alexander Margolies in recording the heart sounds in two experiments. Dr. C. C. Wolferth loaned us an electrocardiograph, Dr. H. C. Bazett gave helpful advice about numerous matters, and Dr. C. J. Wiggers made a suggestion which we promptly investigated. APPARATUS.},

abstract = {Objective: Geriatric patients, especially those with dementia or in a delirious state, do not accept conventional contact-based monitoring. Therefore, we propose to measure heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) of geriatric patients in a noncontact and unobtrusive way using photoplethysmography imaging (PPGI). Methods: PPGI video sequences were recorded from 10 geriatric patients and 10 healthy elderly people using a monochrome camera operating in the near-infrared spectrum and a colour camera operating in the visible spectrum. PPGI waveforms were extracted from both cameras using superpixel-based regions of interests (ROI). A classifier based on bagged trees was trained to automatically select artefact-free ROIs for HR estimation. HRV was calculated in the time-domain and frequency-domain. Results: an RMSE of 1.03 bpm and a correlation of 0.8 with the reference was achieved using the NIR camera for HR estimation. Using the RGB camera, RMSE and correlation improved to 0.48 bpm and 0.95, respectively. Correlation for HRV in the frequency-domain (LF/HF-ratio) was 0.50 using the NIR camera and 0.70 using the RGB camera. Conclusion: We were able to demonstrate that PPGI is very suitable to measure HR and HRV in geriatric patients. We strongly believe that PPGI will become clinically relevant in monitoring of geriatric patients. Significance: we are the first group to measure both HR and HRV in awake geriatric patients using PPGI. Moreover, we systematically evaluate the effects of the spectrum (near-infrared vs. visible), ROI, and additional motion artefact reduction algorithms on the accuracy of estimated HR and HRV.},

abstract = {Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is known for fluctuating heart rates and an increased risk of developing arrhythmias. The current reference for heartbeat analysis is an electrocardiogram (ECG). As an unobtrusive alternative, we tested a sensor foil for mechanical vibrations to perform a ballistocardiography (BCG) and applied a novel algorithm for beat-to-beat cycle length detection. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between beat-to-beat cycle length detection by the BCG algorithm and simultaneously recorded ECG. In 21 patients suspected for SDB undergoing polysomnography, we compared ECG to simultaneously recorded BCG data analysed by our algorithm. We analysed 362.040 heartbeats during a total of 93 hours of recording. The baseline beat-to-beat cycle length correlation between BCG and ECG was r s = 0.77 (n = 362040) with a mean absolute difference of 15 ± 162 ms (mean cycle length: ECG 923 ± 220 ms; BCG 908 ± 203 ms). After filtering artefacts and improving signal quality by our algorithm, the correlation increased to r s = 0.95 (n = 235367) with a mean absolute difference in cycle length of 4 ± 72 ms (ECG 920 ± 196 ms; BCG 916 ± 194 ms). We conclude that our algorithm, coupled with a BCG sensor foil provides good correlation of beat-to-beat cycle length detection with simultaneously recorded ECG.},
